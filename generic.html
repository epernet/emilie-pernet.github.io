								<h2>Education</h2>
								<p>I started my degree at the University of Surrey in September 2020, and I am planning on graduating in June 2024. Throughout my years of studies, I had the chance to take part in numerous lab experiments, group and computational projects. As part of the Nuclear Astrophysics course, I had various modules, amongst which: Special Relativity, Atoms to Lasers, Nuclear Astrophysics, Modern Computational Techniques, and Research Techniques in Astronomy.  </p>
								<p>I received "The Department of Physics Level 5 Prize" for the best overall performance at Level 5 (second year) of the Physics UG Programmes and "The Dr. Chris Sullivan Prize": for the best performing second-year student in Atoms to Lasers.</p>
								<h2>Work</h2>
								<p>I have been working at the Instituto de Astrofísica de Canarias since February 2023, as part of my MPhys course. I work with Dr. Ignacio Martín-Navarro and Dr. Alina Boeker in TRACES research group. Together we have explored the [&alpha;/Fe]-&sigma; relation for massive galaxies, using the state-of-art models and tools of Full Spectral Fitting. We also investigated the impact of variable IMF on the [&alpha;/Fe]-&sigma; relation using Full Index Fitting. I had the opportunity to present our work by giving a talk at the "A Life Devoted to Stellar Population" conference (the recording should be available soon).<p>
